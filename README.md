*Todo projekt in Vanilla Javascript*

A project in class basic javascript, making a todo list with certain
features. The list should have hardcoded todos that you can can remove, and all this
should be made in javascript in for example ul/li form, with as little as possible HTML. 

Extra features could include ability to add Todos, and check them as done without removing. Also the function to sort the list in any optional way. 

Im trying to keep the code as clean as possible, keeping naming simple and understandable with using camelCase and so, to avoid having too much comments. This project took longer time than I thought, so I had to forego using SCSS and GULP as I originally planned, this time it is just pure CSS.
